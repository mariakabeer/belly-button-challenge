belly-button-challenge
With this challenge, I relied heavily upon forums online to determine which way I wanted to set up my app in terms of coding style. I was also unsure of whether or not to add additional lines regarding d3 into the head of
of the html or if the existing lines under were sufficient. I ended up opting to just include it in the head as well. I used past lecture recordings as well as ChatGBT and W3 to answer all other questions.
I had to make a second final commit because I needed to bring my html file to the main branch in order to make the correct GitHub Page.
